at(): Returns the reference to the element at a particular position (can also be done using ‘[ ]’ operator). Its time complexity is O(1).
back(): Returns the reference to the last element. Its time complexity is O(1).
begin(): Returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the vector. Its time complexity is O(1).
clear(): Deletes all the elements from the vector and assign an empty vector. Its time complexity is O(N) where N is the size of the vector.
empty(): Returns a boolean value, true if the vector is empty and false if the vector is not empty. Its time complexity is O(1).
end(): Returns an iterator pointing to a position which is next to the last element of the vector. Its time complexity is O(1).
erase(): Deletes a single element or a range of elements. Its time complexity is O(N + M) where N is the number of the elements erased and M is the number of the elements moved.
front(): Returns the reference to the first element. Its time complexity is O(1).
insert(): Inserts new elements into the vector at a particular position. ts time complexity is O(N + M) where N is the number of elements inserted and M is the number of the elements moved .
pop_back(): Removes the last element from the vector. Its time complexity is O(1).
push_back(): Inserts a new element at the end of the vector. Its time complexity is O(1).
resize(): Resizes the vector to the new length which can be less than or greater than the current length. Its time complexity is O(N) where N is the size of the resized vector.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the vector. Its time complexity is O(1).
