Note: N is the number of elements in map.
Some Member Functions of map:
at( ): Returns a reference to the mapped value of the element identified with key.Its time complexity is O(logN). 
count( ): searches the map for the elements mapped by the given key and returns the number of matches.As map stores each element with unique key, then it will return 1 if match if found otherwise return 0.Its time complexity is O(logN). 
clear( ): clears the map, by removing all the elements from the map and leaving it with its size 0.Its time complexity is O(N). 
begin( ): returns an iterator(explained above) referring to the first element of map.Its time complexity is O(1). 
end( ): returns an iterator referring to the theoretical element(doesn’t point to an element) which follows the last element.Its time complexity is O(1).
empty( ): checks whether the map is empty or not. It doesn’t modify the map.It returns 1 if the map is empty otherwise returns 0.Its time complexity is O(1).
erase( ): removes a single element or the range of element from the map.
find( ): Searches the map for the element with the given key, and returns an iterator to it, if it is present in the map otherwise it returns an iterator to the theoretical element which follows the last element of map.Its time complexity is O(logN). 
insert( ): insert a single element or the range of element in the map.Its time complexity is O(logN), when only element is inserted and O(1) when position is also given.
