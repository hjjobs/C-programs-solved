pop( ): deletes an element from another end if queue(front). Its time complexity is O(1). 
front( ): access the element on the front end of queue. Its time complexity is O(1). 
empty( ): checks if the queue is empty or not. Its time complexity is O(1). 
size( ): returns the size of queue. Its time complexity is O(1).
